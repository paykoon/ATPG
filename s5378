----------Initialization of circuit----------
1. Blif parsing is started. 
   Blif parsing is completed. Time: 0.009553 seconds.
   The number of gates in the circuit is 1912
2. Gate connecting is started.
   Gate connecting is completed. Time: 0.003586 seconds.
----------The initialization of the Circuit takes 0.013184 seconds----------



----------Initialization of ATPG----------
1. SSA Fault list generation is started. 
   SSA Fault number is 3444 (Collapsed: AIG's input wire connected to PI or fanout)
   Total SSA faults number: 10426, 33.0328% fault are selected by the fault model
   Time: 1.2e-05 seconds.
2. Initial CNF generation is started.
   Time: 0.018771 seconds.
3. Read initial SSAF test patterns.
   102 SSAF patterns are read
   Build the connection between SSAF and the initial test set.
   (We just assume that the initial test patterns can cover all SSAF)
