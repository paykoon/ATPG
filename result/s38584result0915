----------Initialization of circuit----------
   The number of gates in the circuit is 16009
   Pair each gate with it's related gates.
   Time: 6.96241 seconds.
   Pair gates that has two fanouts with its related reconvergent gate
   Time: 0.267812 seconds.
----------Time 7.12748 seconds----------

----------Initialization of CNF formula----------
----------Time: 0.10912 seconds----------


----------Initialization of ATPG----------
1. SSA Fault list generation. 
   SSA Fault number is 30748 (Collapsed: AIG's input wire connected to PI or fanout)
   Total SSA faults number: 88824, 34.6168% fault are selected by the fault model
   Time: 0.169378 seconds.
2. Read initial SSAF test patterns.
   174 SSAF patterns are read
   Build the connection between SSAF and the initial test set.
